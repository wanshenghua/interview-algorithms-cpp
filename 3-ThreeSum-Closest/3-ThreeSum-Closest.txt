Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

Understanding:

S: n int.
a,b,c \in S st. s=a+b+c -> target closest.
return s

Idea:
sort, two-pointer scan,
keep track of minimum abs(target-sum) and the solution
